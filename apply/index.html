    <p>I am using Atom as my text editor to complete this assignment.</p>

    <p>When designing a website, it is important that the website loads quickly
      and has an attractive design and color scheme. Furthermore, the website
      needs to be easy to read and navigate.</p>

    <p>In chapter 1, I learned about the software needed to begin designing
        a website and what the basic HTML tags I need to use to do so.
